        &nbsp;&nbsp;Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns - this too widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding. That's why we're partnering with a coalition of forty-six countries. I know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;That's not what I'm talking about. For the African-American community, that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future. The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom. That is the spirit we need today.
